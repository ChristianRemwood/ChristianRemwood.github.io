## Welcome to Christian Remwood's page

I am always the worst about writing about myself so I hope you dont judge me too harshly! After all, engineers arent known for their social skills. 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
while(1)
{
  FreakAboutWhatToSay();
}
```
